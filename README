== Shopping Cart Example - based upon the version from Agile for Web Development with Rails

This is a typical shopping cart app based upon the one described in the tutorial in DHH's Rails book. I
put this together for a couple reasons: 1) I can probably re-use it as its a common app; 2) Its a good
testing ground for trying out new things; 3) My wife can use it to sell her vintage clothing vs. use a paid
service.


== Technologies Used

1. Ruby 1.8.7 / Rails 2.3.8 / MySQL

2. Amazon S3 / Paperclip for image storage and backend

3. Haml for markup

4. Ancestry gem for categorization of data - very nice gem

5. Norman's Friendly_id for URL slugging
